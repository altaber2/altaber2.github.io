Hi! I'm a junior computer engineering student at Virginia Tech with a passion for software development, embedded systems, and problem-solving. I spent three years as an intern at Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division, where I gained hands-on experience in engineering projects and software development.

Beyond coding, I enjoy playing soccer, going to the gym, and gaming. I'm always looking for opportunities to learn, build, and collaborate on exciting projects. Feel free to check out my repositories and reach out!
